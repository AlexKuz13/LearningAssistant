I set myself the goal of creating a client-server application based on Android OS, in which people can turn to other people for help if they have any problems with their studies.
Users can discuss their questions and tasks in a personal chat, as well as evaluate the interlocutor. 
Using this application, the student will develop: he will learn to solve different problems, and can also learn a lot of new things. 
And people who help others can gain experience and popularity, which in the future can lead to earnings in this area.
